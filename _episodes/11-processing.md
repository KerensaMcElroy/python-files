title: file processing

Python excells at processing text files. This is because:

* Python reads files line-by-line, one at a time
* Each line is read in as a `string`
* Strings are easy to manipulate in Python, using functions, methods, and indexing

In this lesson, we will workshop an example using an input data file in 'fasta' format.
